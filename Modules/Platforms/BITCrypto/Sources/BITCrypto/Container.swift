  /// a significant computational delay (~1 second) on typical devices, satisfying the purpose of a key derivation
  /// function in mitigating brute-force attacks.

  /// This choice must be reinforced by a second layer of security: encryption using a key stored
  /// in the Secure Enclave. This makes the derived key infeasible to compute on external high-performance systems.
